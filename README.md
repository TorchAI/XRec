## Issues
Everyone is welcome to file issues with either feature requests, bug reports, or general questions. As a small team with only one person, we may ask for contributions if a prompt fix doesn't fit into our roadmap. We allow users a two week window to follow up on questions, after which we will close issues. They can be re-opened if there is further discussion.

## Contributions
If you would like to contribute a larger feature, we recommend first creating an issue with a proposed design for discussion. This will prevent you from spending significant time on an implementation which has a technical limitation someone could have pointed out early on. Small contributions can be made directly in a pull request.

Pull requests (PRs) must have one approving review and no requested changes before they are merged.
